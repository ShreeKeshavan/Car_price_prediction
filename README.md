**Project Description:** Car Price Prediction

As part of my data science coursework, I undertook a project focused on car price prediction. The objective of this project was to develop a predictive model that could accurately estimate the prices of cars based on various features. This project allowed me to apply my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and programming to solve a real-world problem.

## **Car Price Prediction with Machine Learning.**
**Key-Points**
* First, we did the Basic Understanding of Data.
* Then we performed Data Cleaning to make the raw data more usable for analysis.
* We identified and handled missing values and other data inconsistencies during the data cleaning process.
* we conducted Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) to gain insights from the data.
* Feature Engineering: We performed feature engineering to create new features or transform existing ones that could improve the predictive power of our model.
* Data Preprocessing: We prepared the data for model training and testing by encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
* We trained our model using different Machine Learning Algorithms, such as Random Forest Regression,Gradient Boosting Regression,Adaboost Regression,Decision Tree Regression etc.. to predict car prices.
* Finally, we evaluated the model's performance and achieved around 95% accuracy with the Random Forest Regression model.
* Based on the high accuracy achieved, we can utilize this model for predicting the price of a car in the future.
* Feature Importance: We analyzed the importance of each feature in the prediction of car prices. This analysis helps in understanding the key factors that contribute the most to the price variation.

## Results:
Through this project, I successfully developed a car price prediction model with an accuracy rate around 95%. The model effectively estimated the prices of used cars based on their features, providing valuable insights to both buyers and sellers in the car market.

This project enhanced my skills in data preprocessing, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis, model building(machine learning algorithms), model evaluation. It showcased my ability to handle real-world datasets, build predictive models, and communicate the results effectively.

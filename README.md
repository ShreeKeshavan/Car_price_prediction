Project Description: Car Price Prediction

As part of my data science coursework, I undertook a project focused on car price prediction. The objective of this project was to develop a predictive model that could accurately estimate the prices of cars based on various features. This project allowed me to apply my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and programming to solve a real-world problem.

## Results:
Through this project, I successfully developed a car price prediction model with an accuracy rate of 95%. The model effectively estimated the prices of used cars based on their features, providing valuable insights to both buyers and sellers in the car market.

This project enhanced my skills in data preprocessing, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis, machine learning algorithms, model evaluation, and web application development. It showcased my ability to handle real-world datasets, build predictive models, and communicate the results effectively.

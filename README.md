Project Description: Car Price Prediction

As part of my data science coursework, I undertook a project focused on car price prediction. The objective of this project was to develop a predictive model that could accurately estimate the prices of used cars based on various features. This project allowed me to apply my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and programming to solve a real-world problem.

## Key Responsibilities:
1. Data Collection: I gathered a comprehensive dataset of used car listings from various online platforms, considering factors such as make, model, year of manufacture, mileage, fuel type, transmission type, and more. I utilized web scraping techniques to extract the required information.

2. Data Preprocessing: The raw data obtained from online sources contained missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. I performed thorough data cleaning, including handling missing data, removing outliers, and resolving inconsistencies to ensure the quality and integrity of the dataset.

3. Feature Engineering: To improve the performance of the predictive model, I conducted feature engineering. This involved transforming and creating new features from the existing dataset, such as extracting information from the car's description or utilizing domain knowledge to derive relevant variables.

4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): I conducted EDA to gain insights into the dataset and identify relationships between variables. This involved visualizing data through graphs and charts, analyzing statistical measures, and discovering patterns or trends that could influence car prices.

5. Model Development: I implemented various machine learning algorithms, including regression models such as linear regression, decision tree regression, and random forest regression. I performed model selection and optimization using techniques like cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning, and feature selection to achieve the best possible performance.

6. Model Evaluation: I assessed the performance of the developed models using appropriate evaluation metrics, such as mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), and R-squared. I compared the performance of different models to identify the most accurate and reliable model for car price prediction.

## Results:
Through this project, I successfully developed a car price prediction model with an accuracy rate of X%. The model effectively estimated the prices of used cars based on their features, providing valuable insights to both buyers and sellers in the used car market.

This project enhanced my skills in data preprocessing, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis, machine learning algorithms, model evaluation, and web application development. It showcased my ability to handle real-world datasets, build predictive models, and communicate the results effectively.
